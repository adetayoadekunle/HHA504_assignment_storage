# Assignment: Working with Cloud Storage in Azure and GCP
## File upload process in both Azure Blob Storage and GCP Cloud Storage using the GUI

## Azure:

## Documentation of the storage management and security features explored in Azure and GCP
## Azure:
While looking at Microsoft Azure, I found the different access tiers interesting on how based on the data is accessed with hot being frequently accessed data, cool being infrequently accessed data, and archive for data that is rarely accessed. With the access policy, it shows the immutable blob storage which is when the data is not changed or deleted when it is saved.

## GCP:
There were different storage classes such as standard which is data you use frequently and coldline which is data used occasionally throughout the year. Regarding Identity and Access Management roles show bucket owner which gives full access to the storage.
